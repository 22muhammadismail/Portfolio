#About me
I am a positive-thinking person who possesses two sides of power. On the one hand, I am organized, structured, and attentive to detail because of my nature. And on the other, I love to communicate with people and solve problems due to my personality.
I got my bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from the Capital University of Science and Technology, Islamabad. I had a keen interest in software testing while I was a student and used to take software classes with all my interest. After graduating, I kicked off my career as a game tester and decided to move forward with it. I started working as a Quality Assurance Analyst (Gaming) at Second Dinner Studios.
